@callstack/async-storage
==================================

> Cross platform local storage with React Native - like API.


Check out working [web example](https://codesandbox.io/s/r9l9ljr04) ðŸ’» and [mobile](https://snack.expo.io/@happiryu/@callstack-async-storage-example) ðŸ“±

In order to use it, just import from either web or native:

```js
import AsyncStorage from '@callstack/async-storage';
```

and call any of the methods available [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html). The API is 100% compatible,
including the errors that can be thrown.

```js
AsyncStorage.setItem('key', 'value')
  .then(() => {})
  .catch(() => {})
```

~**Warning:** Unlike React Native AsyncStorage, this module doesn't accept callbacks. If you are already using Promises or async/await, this warning can be ignored.~

Sice the version 1.1.0 we do support **callbacks** (along with promises) for methods `setItem`, `getItem`, `removeItem` and `getAllKeys`. That's mean that this library now plays well with e.g. [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist). :rocket:
