```
with
```
[[Appboy sharedInstance] registerDeviceToken:deviceToken];

## 1.11.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 3.2.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#320).
  - Added `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to directly use the Firebase messaging event `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT`. This is now the recommended way to integrate Firebase push with Braze. The `AppboyFcmReceiver` should be removed from your `AndroidManifest` and replaced with the following:
    ```
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
    - Also note that any `c2dm` related permissions should be removed from your manifest as Braze does not require any extra permissions for `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to work correctly.
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.14.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.14.0).

- Updated the Android wrapper to use `api` and `implementation` syntax in it's `build.gradle` instead of `compile`. As part of this work, the Android Gradle plugin version was updated to `3.2.1`.

##### Added
- Added `setUserAttributionData()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow setting the attribution data for the current user.
- Added `getInstallTrackingId()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow getting the install tracking id. This method is equivalent to calling `Appboy.getInstallTrackingId()` on Android and returns the IDFV on iOS.
- Added `setLanguage()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow setting a language for the current user.
- Added `hideCurrentInAppMessage()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow hiding of the currently displayed in-app message.

  - __Important:__ Note that in Braze Android SDK 2.7.0, `AppboyGcmReceiver` was renamed to `AppboyFcmReceiver`. This receiver is intended to be used for Firebase integrations. Please update the `AppboyGcmReceiver` declaration in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to reference `AppboyFcmReceiver` and remove the `com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION` intent filter action.
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.8.3](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.8.3).

##### Added
- Added `setLocationCustomAttribute()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow setting of custom location attributes.

## 1.7.3

##### Added

## 1.2.0

##### Breaking
- Updates the native iOS bridge to be compatible with React Native [v0.40.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.40.0).

##### Changed
- Updates the AppboyProject sample project to React Native v0.41.1.

## 1.1.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Fixes a bug in the [iOS bridge](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/blob/master/iOS/AppboyReactBridge/AppboyReactBridge/AppboyReactBridge.m) where custom attribute dates were converted incorrectly, causing incorrect date data to be sent to Braze. As a result of the fix, `setDateCustomUserAttribute()` in the iOS React bridge may now only be called with a double.
  - Note: The default Javascript Braze interface has not changed, so for most integrations this just requires updating the SDK, unless you were manually calling our iOS bridge outside of our recommended integration.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/issues/7

## 1.0.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Updates iOS push handling in the AppboyProject sample project to be compatible with iOS 10. For more information, refer to the CHANGELOG for [Braze iOS SDK v2.24.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2240).

- Exposes `ReactAppboy.setTwitterData()` and `ReactAppboy.setFacebookData()` for Twitter and Facebook integration.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/issues/4

##### Changed
- Targets [Braze Android SDK version 1.15.3](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1153) and [Braze iOS SDK version 2.24.2](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2242).
- Updates the AppboyProject sample application to React Native v0.33.0.
